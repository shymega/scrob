scrob
=====

Welcome, to the future of audio scrobblers! Meet scrob: an extendable audio
scrobbler written in Rust.

scrob works with the concepts of 'sources' and 'targets'.

Targets are a *destination* for scrobbles, such as GNU FM (Libre.fm,
for example), Last.fm or ListenBrainz.

Sources are a *source* of data for scrobbles to be formed from, such
as MPD, or MPRIS.

## Project status

Working on project locally. Refactoring to introduce queues, worker
threads,and proper error handling - especially with sources and
targets.

## IRC
